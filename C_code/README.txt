The code present in this file provides root-level
access to the parallel port. The parallel port is
setup in the Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP) mode
and communicates using direct I/O. This is to ensure
maximum speed transfer between devices and reduce
software loop overhead times associated more commonly
with user-level programs.
